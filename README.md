## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashikabeed650/CodeAlpha_SimpleEcommerceStore.git
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

Before seeding, copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`. The seed command adds missing sample products and does not delete existing products.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

For local frontend development, copy `client/.env.example` to `client/.env` and set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`.

## 🚀 Deploying to Vercel

The frontend and backend are separate Vercel projects in this repository. Deploy the backend first, then configure the frontend to use its URL.

### 1. Prepare MongoDB and seed products

Create a MongoDB database and allow connections from your hosting environment. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`, enter the MongoDB connection string and a long, private JWT secret, then run `npm run seed` from the `backend` directory. Never commit `.env` or enter backend secrets in the frontend project.

### 2. Deploy the backend

- Import the repository as a new Vercel project and set **Root Directory** to `backend`.
- Add `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` under the backend project's **Settings → Environment Variables**.
- Deploy. The backend's `vercel.json` configures the API function and includes the product images.
- Verify the deployment root responds, and that `/api/products` returns the seeded products.

### 3. Deploy the frontend

- Import the same repository as a second Vercel project and set **Root Directory** to `client`.
- Add `VITE_API_URL` under **Settings → Environment Variables**, set to the backend deployment URL followed by `/api` (for example, `https://your-backend-project.vercel.app/api`).
- Deploy. The client Vercel rewrite supports direct visits and refreshes on routes such as `/products` and `/cart`.

`VITE_API_URL` is required for production builds. If the frontend build reports it missing, add it to the frontend project's Vercel environment variables and redeploy. If the product API returns a database error, check the backend project's `MONGO_URI` and MongoDB network access.

## 📝 Recent updates

- Added entrance and hover animations to the Home hero, CTA and category cards (CSS keyframes in client/src/index.css).
- Re-added user greeting in the navigation bar: "Hello, <name>" with a Logout button (client/src/components/Navbar.jsx).
- Fixed order Authorization flow by automatically attaching the JWT token to outgoing API requests via a request interceptor (client/src/api/api.js). This prevents malformed/masked headers and 401s when placing orders.
- Address-on-map checkout remains available (react-leaflet + Nominatim reverse geocoding). Orders now store address.display_name and coordinates in the backend.
- Admin UI and admin product endpoints remain removed per earlier request.

Notes:
- The API client now appends Authorization: Bearer <token> from localStorage. If you prefer explicit header control per-call, revert the interceptor in client/src/api/api.js.
- Pushing to remote requires proper git remote and permissions; see below for commit/push status.
